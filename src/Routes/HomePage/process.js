Every pet deserves a loving, permanent home, and we don't let our pets languish
without one!

What does that mean?

That means, our pets are adopted on a first come, first served basis. Our pets wait
in line to be adopted, just as customers wait in line to be adopted.

As a customer, you may pick whether you would like to adopt a CAT, a DOG, or BOTH!
Simply click the corresponding button and you will be added to the line of people waiting
to fill their home.

Click START now to see the front of the line and get your pet today!`
